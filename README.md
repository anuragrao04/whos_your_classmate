# Whos your classmate?

## Description

This is a simple C program that helps colleges like PES divide students into classrooms more efficiently rather than making it purely SRN based.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following commands

```bash
cd whos_your_classmate
make
./main
```

- NOTE: If the input_students.txt file is not present or you want to change it, run the python file `generate_input.py`. Make sure you have run `pip install indian-names` before running the python file.
